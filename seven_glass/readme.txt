#-This is a XOOPS 2.0.5 theme made by Seven-#
Theme uses the default Template (I dont understand that stuffs fully yet:)
I have not tested themes on MAC, I can only hope and assume they work.
This is one of my first attempts at themeing, I have tested themes and as best I can see they work fine, but if you decide to use it on your site, you may want to test it yourself.
I would love any feedback I could get, negative or positive.
You may do with this theme whatever you like except offer it as a download claiming it as your own creation. You may offer it as a download as long as this README is included in ZIP.
This theme is based on the default XOOPS theme, I just modified CSS, Graphix and very little code. I dont claim to have made this theme from scratch, I'm not brainy enough to do that :)
